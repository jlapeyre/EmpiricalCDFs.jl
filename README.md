Provides [empirical cumulative distribution functions (CDFs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_distribution_function)
(or "empirical distribution functions" as they are know to probabalists).

See the documentation [https://jlapeyre.github.io/EmpiricalCDFs.jl/latest](https://jlapeyre.github.io/EmpiricalCDFs.jl/latest).

~~I'm surprised that this module is not more popular (if stars are a good measure) because it's rather generic,
I use it frequently for new projects,
and the functionality is not available elsewhere.~~ In the meantime it's gained some stars.

*EmpiricalCDFs* implements empirical CDFs; building, evaluating, random sampling, evaluating the inverse, etc.
It is useful especially for examining the
tail of the CDF obtained from streaming a large number of data, more than can be stored in memory.
For this purpose, you specify a lower cutoff; data points below this value will be silently rejected, but the
resulting CDF will still be properly normalized. This ability to process and filter data [online](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_algorithm)
is absent in `StatsBase.ecdf`.
